    "### problem : In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea.\n",

A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.

For states where independent cities are county-equivalents, the word \"city\" is included to identify the independent cities and to differentiate them from counties with identical names; the counties with the identical names have the word \"county\" following them. The word \"county\" is included in the names of counties that have names identical to the names of U.S. states or cities to differentiate them."
